- infrastructure as code
  eg. Terraform
- instead of using manual processes to set up infrastructure, use code instead
- write a script to build the infrastructure for us, and run on AWS
- codifying the creation, provisioning and configuration of infrastructure

- creation of cloud resources and management of code (configuration) using automation
- think about time invested, and how much time it will save you


**Issues that may arise from manually creating cloud infrastructure:**
- not standardised
- slow
- not as secure as can be
- not portable
- not optimised
- not collaborative
- not scalable
- no version control
  
# Orchestration
- terraform etc.
- process of automating and coordinating complex workflows

# Configuration
- ansible, chef etc
- maintaining and updating configuration of hardware, software, resources
